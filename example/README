This is a sample configuration of the event processor. 
 
An example is deployed on http://bam.orwall.se 

IRC:
Creating data events with name irc/[channel] on each message in the IRC channels #scala and #cassandra 
	
	- KeywordProcessors is used to categorize these data events:
		- by nick: irc/[channel]/nick/[nick] [ /
		- by all words in each message like this: irc/[channel]/word/[word] (which makes it possible to search the messages)
		
	- KpiProcessor is used to :
		- count the word in the message and put the value in the kpi event: irc/[channel]/count
		
	- A OccurenceAnalyser alarms if a user writes more than 5 messages in one minute
			
TRAIN ARRIVALS:
This is a data event with the name "/train/arrival" created when a train arrives at a station in the swedish railway network. 

	- KeywordProcessors categorize the data events:
		- by train number: train/arrival/trainno/[number]
		- by station: train/arrival/station/[station signature]
		
	- KpiProcessors listens to the categorized events "train/arrival/trainNo/*" and "train/arrival/station/*" and:
		- creates kpi events with then name train/arrival/trainno/[number]/delay train/arrival/station/[station signature]/delay and with the delay in minutes as value
		
	- A ValueAnalyser alarms if the average delay is more than 10 minutes under one hour
	
GITHUB COMMITS:
Data events created every time a commit is made to the projects scala/scala, jboner/akka, apache/cassandra, aorwall/bam, with the event name github/commit/[user]/[repo]

	- KeywordProcessors categorize the data events:
		- by committing user: github/commit/[user]/[repo]/commiter/[username] 
		
	- KpiProcessors is:
		- counting the number of modifications in kpi event: github/commit/[user]/[repo]/modifications
		- counting the number of deletions in kpi event: github/commit/[user]/[repo]/deletions
		- counting the number of insertions in kpi event: github/commit/[user]/[repo]/insertions

	- A ValueAnalyser alarms if there are more than 100 deleted files in one day in any repo.

WEATHER:
Data events with the name /weather/[city] is created hourly with weather info in Stockholm and Gothenburg

	- KpiProcessors is:
		- creating new kpi events with the temperature as value: weather/[city]/temperature 
		
	- XXXANalyser alarms if the temperature changes more than xxxX in one day (klura liteh Ã¤r!)

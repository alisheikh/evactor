This is a sample configuration of the event processor. 
 
IRC:
Creating data events with name irc/[channel] on each message in the IRC channels #scala and #cassandra 
	
	- KeywordProcessors are used to categorize these data events:
		- by nick: irc/[channel]/nick/[nick] 
		- by all words in each message like this: irc/[channel]/word/[word] (not implemented)
		
	- A KpiProcessor is used to :
		- count the word in the message and put the value in the kpi event: irc/[channel]/count
		
	- A OccurenceAnalyser alarms if a user writes more than 5 messages in one minute (not implemented)
			
TRAIN ARRIVALS:
A data event with the name "/train/arrival" is created when a train arrives at a station in the swedish railway network. 

	- KeywordProcessors categorize the data events:
		- by train number: train/arrival/trainno/[number]
		- by station: train/arrival/station/[station signature]
		
	- KpiProcessors listens to the categorized events "train/arrival/trainNo/*" and "train/arrival/station/*" and:
		- creates kpi events with then name train/arrival/trainno/[number]/delay train/arrival/station/[station signature]/delay and with the delay in minutes as value
		
	- A ValueAnalyser alarms if the average delay is more than 10 minutes under one hour (not implemented)
	
GITHUB COMMITS:
Data events created every time a commit is made to the projects scala/scala, jboner/akka, apache/cassandra, aorwall/evactor, with the event name github/commits/[repo]

	- KeywordProcessors categorize the data events:
		- by committing user: github/commits/[repo]/committer/[username] 
		
	- KpiProcessors is:
		- counting the number of modifications in kpi event: github/commits/[repo]/modifications
		- counting the number of deletions in kpi event: github/commits/[repo]/deletions
		- counting the number of insertions in kpi event: github/commits/[repo]/insertions

	- A ValueAnalyser alarms if there are more than 100 deleted files in one day in any repo. (not implemented)

WEATHER (not implemented):
Data events with the name /weather/[city] is created hourly with weather data from Stockholm and Gothenburg

	- KpiProcessors is:
		- creating new kpi events with the temperature as value: weather/[city]/temperature 
		
	- XXXANalyser alarms if the temperature changes more than xxxX in one day....
